How to make better introductions
--------------------------------

Before we get to the data, we're excited to share our first featured user tip on how to make powerful intros. This is from Pascal Finette, Director at the Office of the Chair at Mozilla. You can find him on Twitter at @pfinette, or we're happy to make an introduction!

Sing their praises. Everybody likes a little praise. As a connector you will find people respond much more positively to your introductions if you add a small, personal comment about the specific abilities of each person to your introduction. A "XYZ is an incredible communicator" at the end of your intro works wonders.
