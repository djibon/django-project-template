To ask {{ reminder.other_email|fullname }} if your intro was helpful, simply reply to this email. The message will go directly to {{ reminder.other_email }}. When they reply youâ€™ll receive the message in your inbox. Intros will also capture a record for you.

Following up on intros is a great way to show you care about how they work out, and to understand your impact so you can make even better intros for the right people. 

Thanks,

The Intros Team
